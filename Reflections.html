    <p><h1><mark>Website</mark></h1></P>
    
    <p><h2>Learning how to build a website has been a game-changer for me. It's not just about picking up technical stuff; it's about discovering a whole new way to express myself and share what I'm passionate about. Making a website has helped me solve problems in creative ways and understand how the internet works better. Plus, it's opened up all sorts of cool opportunities, like showing off my work, starting a blog, or even selling things online. It's like learning a new language that lets me speak to the world in my own unique way.</h2><p>
    
    <p><h1><mark>Biography</mark></h1></p>
    
    <p><h2>Learning how to write my life story, or an autobiography, has been like putting together the pieces of a big puzzle about myself. It's not just about listing what happened; it's about understanding why things happened and how they shaped me. Writing my autobiography has helped me learn more about myself, like what I'm good at, what I struggle with, and what makes me happy. It's like taking a journey through my own life, and with each step, I get to know myself a little better. Plus, it's been really cool to see how everything fits together and how far I've come.</h2></p>
    
    <p><h1><mark>Plagiarism</mark></h1></P>
    
    <p><h2>Learning about plagiarism has made a big difference in how I approach my school and work tasks. Now that I understand what plagiarism is and why it's wrong, I make sure to always give credit to the people whose ideas I use. This means I cite my sources carefully and try to come up with my own ideas instead of copying others'. It's not just about following the rules; it's about being honest and showing respect for the hard work of others. This change has not only made my work better but also made me realize the importance of original thinking and contributing something unique to the world.</h2></p>
    
    <p><h1><mark>Egronomics</mark></h1></P>
    
    <p><h2>Learning about ergonomics has made a big difference in how I feel and work every day. It's all about setting up my workspace and doing tasks in a way that keeps me comfortable and healthy. For example, adjusting my chair and computer screen to the right height has helped me avoid back and neck pain. Also, paying attention to my posture and how I move while working has made me feel less tired and more focused. Overall, learning about ergonomics has helped me work better and feel better while doing it.</h2></p>
    
    <p><h1><mark>Company Pamphlet</mark></h1></P>
    
    <p><h2>Understanding how to create a company pamphlet has been really helpful for me. It's like knowing how to make a cool brochure that explains what a company does in a simple and attractive way. With this knowledge, I can now create pamphlets that grab people's attention and clearly explain what our company is all about. This has made it easier for us to communicate our message to customers and clients, which ultimately helps our business grow. Plus, it's fun to get creative and design something that looks great and gets the point across. Learning about company pamphlets has definitely been a valuable skill for me.</h2></p>
    
    <p><h1><mark>Parts of a Computer</mark></h1></P>
    
    <p><h2>Learning about the different parts of a computer has been super helpful for me. It's like learning how all the pieces fit together to make the whole thing work. Now, when something goes wrong with my computer, I have a better idea of what might be causing it. For example, if it's running slow, I might check the memory or the hard drive to see if they're full. Understanding the parts also helps me when I'm buying a new computer or upgrading an old one. I know what to look for in terms of things like processor speed or graphics card capabilities. Overall, knowing about the parts of a computer has made me more confident in using and troubleshooting technology in my daily life.</h2></p>
